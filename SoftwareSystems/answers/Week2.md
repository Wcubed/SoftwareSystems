# Answers

## 2.1
See Rectangle.java.

##2.2
Done

## 2.3
I think you could only assert that the area and perimeter must be positive.

## 2.4 - 2.5
See `ss.week2.test.RectangleTest.java`.
Question: Is `//@ ensure \old() ==> new` the way to go here?

## 2.6 - 2.7
Done, see `ss.week2.ThreeWayLight.java`.

## 2.8
Not done yet See `ss.week2.hotel.Safe.java`.

## 2.9
See `ss.week2.tests.SafeTest.java`.

## 2.10
See `ss.week2.hotel.Save.java`.

## 2.11
The safe class is almost fully covered. It only misses 1 branchs with both of the assert (null).

## 2.12
`-ea` means "Enable Asserts". The first execution does not give errors.
With `-ea` it crashes at the assertion.

## 2.13
